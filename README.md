# Websites
These are websites I have built. I have a simple HTML template and use PHP to replace the needed components. I try to keep scripting to a minimum by doing as much as reasonably possible in CSS.

http://www.tccvalet.com - This site is currently only optimized for Google Chrome.

# Wordpress Sites
These are various wordpress sites I have built. I have mixed feelings on wordpress; at best it's nice, at worst it's restrictive. Some of these websites are on temporary domains and might go down until I update them here.
